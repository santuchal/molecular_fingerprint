# Molecular Fingerprint


# Definition:

Fingerprints entail a conceptual depiction of specific structural attributes within a molecule.

# Usage of Molecular Fingerprint:

## 1.  Search and Comparison
Given a potent active molecule, find similar ones or reverse(dissimilar) but also potent.
## 2.  Prediction
Given a set of active & inactive molecules build a model to predict which members from a large collection will be active
## 3.  Clustering
Given a set of molecules, do they cluster into structurally different groups. 

# Types of Molecular Fingerprint

Numerous varieties of fingerprints exist, with 'keyed' fingerprints denoting the presence or absence of distinct structural attributes. The length of these fingerprints can range from 166 to 4096 bits or even more.
